### 🗑️ Code Cleanup
**Removed unused files:**
- `src/components/Input-container.tsx` (ZK proof UI)
- `src/components/popover-date-picker.tsx` (Map date picker)
- `src/hooks/use-prove-position.tsx` (ZK proof logic)
- `src/hooks/use-state.tsx` (Old contract state)
- `src/hooks/use-boolean.tsx` (Unused utility)

**Removed dependencies from old implementation:**
- Leaflet map libraries (kept but can be removed)
- Noir ZK proof libraries (kept for now)
- Map-related type definitions

### 🏗️ New Architecture

#### State Management (Zustand)
```
src/store/
├── employees.ts    # Employee data management
└── streams.ts      # Payment stream tracking
```

**Features:**
- Persistent storage (localStorage)
- Type-safe state
- Actions for CRUD operations
- Computed values (active streams, total flow rate)

#### Smart Contract Integration
```
src/lib/contract.ts
```

**Configured:**
- Superfluid CFA (Constant Flow Agreement) ABI
- Super Token ABI (ERC20 + streaming functions)
- Sepolia testnet contract addresses
- **PayPal USD (PYUSD) integration**
- Utility functions:
  - `calculateFlowRate()` - Salary → flow rate
  - `flowRateToAnnualSalary()` - Flow rate → salary

**Contract Addresses (Sepolia):**
- CFA: `0x18fB38404DADeE1727Be4b805c5b242B5413Fa40`
- PYUSDx: Update with actual Super PYUSD address

#### Custom Hooks
```
src/hooks/
├── use-streams.tsx         # Superfluid operations
└── use-token-balances.tsx  # Token balance queries
```

**Stream Operations:**
- `useCreateStream()` - Start payment stream
- `useUpdateStream()` - Modify flow rate  
- `useDeleteStream()` - Stop stream
- `useGetFlow()` - Query stream details
- `useGetNetFlow()` - Net flow for account

#### UI Components

**New Directories Created:**
```
src/components/
├── employees/
│   ├── add-employee-dialog.tsx   # Add employee form
│   └── employee-list.tsx          # Employee table
├── streams/
│   └── start-stream-dialog.tsx   # Stream configuration
└── dashboard/
    └── dashboard-stats.tsx        # Stats cards
```

**UI Primitives Added:**
```
src/components/ui/
├── card.tsx       # Card container
├── badge.tsx      # Status badges
├── avatar.tsx     # User avatars
└── select.tsx     # Dropdown select (via shadcn)
```
