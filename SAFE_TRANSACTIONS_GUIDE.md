# Safe Transactions Integration Guide

## 🎯 Overview

We've successfully integrated **Safe React Hooks SDK** to create and sign multisig transactions. Now you have a complete prototype for creating transactions in one wallet and signing them with another wallet.

## 📋 What We Built

### 1. **PendingTransactionsCard Component**
**Location:** `src/components/safe/pending-transactions-card.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Fetches pending transactions using `getPendingTransactions()` from Safe React Hooks
- ✅ Displays transaction details (hash, method, parameters)
- ✅ Shows signature progress (X of Y signatures)
- ✅ Lists all signers who have signed
- ✅ "Sign Transaction" button using `confirmTransaction()`
- ✅ Shows "You Already Signed" if current wallet signed
- ✅ Auto-execute notification when threshold is about to be met
- ✅ Real-time updates of transaction status

**Safe Hooks Used:**
```typescript
const { getPendingTransactions } = useSafe()
const { data: pendingTxs = [] } = getPendingTransactions()
const { confirmTransaction } = useConfirmTransaction()

// Sign a transaction
await confirmTransaction({
  safeTxHash: tx.safeTxHash,
})
```

### 2. **Updated Workspace Dashboard**
**Location:** `src/app/workspace/page.tsx`

**Added:**
- Pending Transactions Card displays below Superfluid Dashboard
- Shows all transactions waiting for signatures
- Visible to all team members

### 3. **Updated Signatures Page**
**Location:** `src/app/workspace/signatures/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Dedicated page for reviewing and signing transactions
- Clean, focused UI for multisig operations
- Help section explaining the signing flow
- Link to app.safe.global for alternative signing

## 🚀 How It Works

### Transaction Flow:

1. **Wallet A Creates Transaction**
   ```typescript
   // In upgrade-downgrade-card.tsx (or any component)
   const { sendTransaction } = useSendTransaction()
   
   const result = await sendTransaction({
     to: tokenAddress,
     value: "0",
     data: encodedData,
   })
   
   console.log("✅ Transaction proposed:", result)
   ```

2. **Transaction Appears in Safe Transaction Service**
   - Automatically stored by Safe infrastructure
   - Visible to all Safe signers
   - Can be viewed in app.safe.global

3. **Wallet B (or other signers) Sign Transaction**
   - Visit `/workspace` or `/workspace/signatures`
   - See pending transaction in `PendingTransactionsCard`
   - Click "Sign Transaction" button
   - Wallet prompts for signature (no gas needed!)
   - Signature added to transaction

4. **Auto-Execution**
   - When threshold is met (e.g., 2 of 3 signatures)
   - Transaction automatically executes on-chain
   - No manual "execute" step needed

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

### Setup (One-time):
1. Deploy Safe wallet with multiple signers (threshold > 1)
2. Configure Safe in app (address, threshold, signers)
3. Fund Safe wallet with PYUSD or test tokens

### Test Steps:

**Wallet A (Creator):**
```bash
1. Connect Wallet A to app
2. Go to /workspace
3. Click "Upgrade/Downgrade" card
4. Click "Step 1: Approve PYUSD"
5. Sign the Safe transaction
6. Check console: "✅ Transaction proposed to Safe:"
```

**Wallet B (Signer):**
```bash
1. Disconnect Wallet A
2. Connect Wallet B (must be a Safe signer)
3. Go to /workspace or /workspace/signatures
4. See pending transaction in card
5. Click "Sign Transaction"
6. Confirm signature in wallet
7. Transaction auto-executes! 🎉
```

## 📊 UI Features

### PendingTransactionsCard Shows:
- **Transaction Hash** (full safeTxHash)
- **Method Name** (e.g., "approve", "upgrade")
- **Parameters** (number of arguments)
- **Signature Progress** 
  - Visual progress bar
  - "2 / 3" count
  - List of signers who signed
- **Action Buttons**
  - "Sign Transaction" (for unsigned)
  - "You Already Signed" (disabled, for signed)
- **Auto-execute Alert**
  - "⚡ This transaction will auto-execute after your signature!"

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Where Transactions Are Created:
1. **Upgrade/Downgrade Card** (`src/components/swap/upgrade-downgrade-card.tsx`)
   - Step 1: Approve PYUSD → Creates Safe transaction
   - Step 2: Upgrade to PYUSDx → Creates Safe transaction

2. **Stream Creation** (TODO)
   ```typescript
   // In start-stream component
   const { sendTransaction } = useSendTransaction()
   
   await sendTransaction({
     to: superfluidAddress,
     value: "0",
     data: createFlowData,
   })
   ```

3. **Add Funds** (TODO)
   ```typescript
   // In add-funds-dialog
   await sendTransaction({
     to: tokenAddress,
     value: "0",
     data: transferData,
   })
   ```

## 🎨 Console Logs

Watch for these console logs to verify transactions:

```bash
# When creating transaction (Wallet A):
✅ Transaction proposed to Safe: {
  safeTxHash: "0x123...",
  safeAddress: "0xabc...",
  ...
}

# When fetching pending transactions (any wallet):
📋 Pending transactions: [
  {
    safeTxHash: "0x123...",
    confirmations: [...],
    dataDecoded: { method: "approve", ... }
  }
]

# When signing transaction (Wallet B):
🖊️ Signing transaction: 0x123...
✅ Transaction signed!
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### Transaction Not Appearing?
1. Check SafeProvider is initialized
   - Look for "SafeProvider initialized" in console
   - Check `isReady` from `useSafeProviderStatus()`

2. Verify transaction was created
   - Check console for "✅ Transaction proposed to Safe:"
   - Check app.safe.global (should appear there too)

3. Check Safe configuration
   - Safe deployed? (`safeConfig.isDeployed`)
   - Correct network? (Sepolia = 11155111)
   - Wallet is signer? (check `safeConfig.signers`)

### Can't Sign?
1. Ensure wallet is one of the Safe signers
2. Check if already signed (button shows "You Already Signed")
3. Verify SafeProvider initialized for current wallet
4. Check network connection to Safe Transaction Service

## 🌐 Alternative: app.safe.global

Users can also sign transactions at:
- https://app.safe.global/home?safe=sep:YOUR_SAFE_ADDRESS

This is useful for:
- Mobile signing
- Alternative UI
- Advanced transaction details
- Transaction history

## 📱 Mobile Support

The `PendingTransactionsCard` is fully responsive:
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Scrollable transaction list
- Truncated addresses for small screens

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Safe** ✅ Ready to test!
   - Deploy Safe with multiple signers
   - Test approve + upgrade flow
   - Verify signatures and auto-execution

2. **Add Stream Transactions**
   - Integrate with Superfluid stream creation
   - Add Safe transactions for createFlow/deleteFlow
   - Show stream transactions in pending list

3. **Transaction History**
   - Use `useTransactionHistory()` hook
   - Show executed transactions
   - Display transaction status timeline

4. **Notifications**
   - Add bell icon badge with pending count
   - Toast notifications for new transactions
   - Email/push notifications (future)

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The prototype is complete. You can now:
- ✅ Create Safe transactions from Wallet A
- ✅ View pending transactions from any signer
- ✅ Sign transactions from Wallet B
- ✅ Auto-execute when threshold met
- ✅ Beautiful UI with real-time updates

**Try it out with your Safe wallet!** 🚀
