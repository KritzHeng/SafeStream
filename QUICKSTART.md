## üìù Important Notes

### Testnet Setup
- The app is configured for **Sepolia testnet** by default
- You'll need testnet ETH for gas fees
- Get testnet ETH from: https://sepoliafaucet.com/

### Super Tokens
- Payment streams use **Super Tokens** (PYUSDx)
- Super Tokens are wrapped versions of PayPal USD
- You need to wrap your PYUSD first (PYUSD ‚Üí PYUSDx)

### Getting Test Tokens
1. Get testnet PYUSD from faucet (check PayPal developer docs)
2. Wrap to PYUSDx using Superfluid dashboard: https://console.superfluid.finance/

### Contract Addresses (Sepolia)
- **CFA (Flow Agreement)**: `0x18fB38404DADeE1727Be4b805c5b242B5413Fa40`
- **PYUSDx (Super PYUSD)**: Update with actual address when deployed

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient balance" error
- Make sure you have testnet ETH for gas
- Ensure you have wrapped PYUSD (PYUSDx)
- Check your balance is greater than the deposit buffer required

### Transaction fails
- Increase gas limit in wallet settings
- Make sure you're on the correct network (Sepolia)
- Check if you have approval for the token

### Stream doesn't appear
- Wait for transaction confirmation (can take 15-30 seconds)
- Refresh the page
- Check transaction on Etherscan: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/

### Can't see employees
- Employees are stored in browser localStorage
- Clear browser cache will reset employee data
- Export data before clearing cache (feature coming soon)
